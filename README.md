# Hi, I'm Mahlatse Seloane 👋

I’m a graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand, holding a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Digital Arts.

Over the past few years, I’ve been exploring game and software development through personal projects and academic work. My focus has shifted from simply building games to deepening my understanding of software fundamentals, system design, and collaborative development workflows. I’m especially interested in structured development, modular design, and learning how real-world projects are planned, executed, and maintained.

I created this GitHub account after losing access to my previous one. All my work going forward will be uploaded and maintained here.

The projects here reflect my ongoing effort to **learn through building**, where I  balance creativity with structured experimentation. My goal is not just to write functional code, but to **explore design decisions, document my thought process, and improve clarity and organization** in each project.

Many of the projects were originally completed during my time at university. I am revisiting them to **better understand software design and collaborative practices**, and to practice applying structured development principles.

This GitHub reflects a phase of learning and growth: developing a more disciplined, thoughtful approach to software that prepares me to contribute effectively in team-based projects.
