# Hi, I'm Mahlatse Seloane 👋

I’m a graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand, holding a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Digital Arts degree. 

Over the past few years, I’ve been working as a Junior Game Developer, which aligns with my academic background. However, my focus has shifted from simply becoming a better game developer to becoming a stronger software developer overall. That means improving my fundamentals while also learning how real-world projects are planned, executed, and maintained. I’m especially interested in structured software development, system design, and collaborative team workflows.

I created this GitHub account after losing access to my previous one. All my work going forward will be uploaded and maintained here.

The projects you’ll find here are part of my effort to build with real-world discipline, applying practices like the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to everything I create. My goal is not just to write clean, functional code, but to think critically about planning, design, documentation, and long-term maintainability.

Many of the projects here were originally completed during my time at university. However, I’m revisiting them using a more professional mindset, and exploring how to manage requirements, constraints, and stakeholder goals more intentionally.

While this GitHub is new, it reflects a turning point in how I intend to approach development: with greater discipline, clarity, and a long-term goal of becoming a reliable, thoughtful contributor on any software team.

## 📘 Why You'll See SDLC-Focused Projects

I’ve begun applying the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** as a learning framework across all my new projects. I’m treating each repo like a real-world case study — with planning, documentation, and structure that mirrors what you’d find in a professional software team.

By following a **Hybrid SDLC model** (a mix of structured planning and iterative development), I’m learning how to:

- Write clear requirement specifications  
- Plan for constraints and edge cases  
- Document assumptions and stakeholder needs  
- Design with maintainability in mind  
- Test and evaluate against defined goals

You’ll find `/docs` folders, structured commits, and clear README files in each project, showing how I work through each SDLC phase. This approach will shape every repo I upload here going forward.
