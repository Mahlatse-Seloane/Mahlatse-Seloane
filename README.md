# Hi, I'm Mahlatse Seloane 👋

I’m a graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand, holding a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Digital Arts degree.

Over the past few years, I’ve been working as a Junior Game Developer, which aligns with my academic background. However, my focus has shifted from simply becoming a better game developer to becoming a stronger software developer overall. That means improving my fundamentals while also learning how real-world projects are planned, executed, and maintained. I’m especially interested in structured software development, system design, and collaborative team workflows.

I created this GitHub account after losing access to my previous one. All my work going forward will be uploaded and maintained here.

The projects you’ll find here represent my ongoing effort to build with real-world discipline — balancing creativity with structure. My goal is not just to write clean, functional code, but to think critically about design, documentation, and long-term maintainability.

Many of the projects here were originally completed during my time at university. I’m now revisiting them with a more professional mindset, focusing on clarity, organization, and intentional decision-making in how each project evolves.

While this GitHub is new, it reflects a turning point in how I approach development: with greater discipline, consistency, and a long-term goal of becoming a reliable, thoughtful contributor on any software team.
